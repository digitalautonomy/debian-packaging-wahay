------

[Wahay](https://wahay.org) is an application that allows you to easily host and participate in conference calls, without the need for any
centralized servers or services. We are building a voice call application that is meant to be as easy-to-use as possible, while still
providing extremely high security and privacy out of the box.

In order to do this, we use [Tor](https://torproject.org) Onion Services in order to communicate between the end-points, and we use the [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info) protocol for the actual voice communication. We are doing extensive user testing in order to ensure that the usability of the application is as good as possible.

## Documentation

For full documentation, visit [wahay.org](https://wahay.org/documentation/index.html).

## Installing

For end-users, please refer to installation instructions on the [website](https://wahay.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/). We provide several different options for installation there. If you are a developer, installing the application should be as easy as cloning the repository and running `make build`.

## Security warning

Wahay is currently under active development. There have been no security audits
of the code, and you should currently not use this for anything sensitive.

## Language

The language to be used is the same configured under `LANG` environment variable.

Example:

```bash
$ export LANG="en_US.utf8"
```

## Compatibility

The current version of Wahay is compatible with all major Linux distributions. It is possible that the application can run on OS X or
Windows, but at this moment we have not tested this. We are planning on adding official OS X and Windows compatibility in the near future.

## About the developers

Wahay is developed by the NGO [Centro de Autonom√≠a Digital](https://autonomia.digital), based in Quito, Ecuador.
